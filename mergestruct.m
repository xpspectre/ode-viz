function combostruct = mergestruct(oldstruct, newstruct)
%MERGESRUCT Merge one structure into another.
%   combostruct = mergestruct(oldstruct, newstruct) adds the fields and
%   values of newstruct into oldstruct and returns the merged structure.
%   For field names that are the same between oldstruct and newstruct, the
%   values in newstruct are returned.

# Ordinary Differential Equation Network Model Visualizer

Visualize concentrations and fluxes through ODE network model. Takes model and dataset of states over time.

Implemented kroneckerbio (https://github.com/kroneckerbio/kroneckerbio) model and simulation extraction.

Pulled in JSONlab (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/33381-jsonlab--a-toolbox-to-encode-decode-json-files) and GetFullPath (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/28249-getfullpath) from the Matlab File Exchange because old versions of Matlab don't have that functionality built-in.
